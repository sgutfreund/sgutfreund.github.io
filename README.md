I had some trouble with my css files, because the changes were lagging a little between pushes so it was confusing to check against my actual site. Also, I had a little confusing with centering the image, and padding my h1. However, it was all pretty easily resolved and I found that this assignment was pretty straightforward and entertaining.

I discussed the very beginning of the assignment with Anna Sethi. Kate Clawson help me with a few questions during the middle part of the assignment (I was having an issue with my stylesheets).

I would say I spent approximately between 3 and 5 hours on this project.
